##### Title: HR Analytics Dashboard

- This project involves the development of an HR Analytics Dashboard to provide insights into the workforce dynamics of a company. The dashboard displays key metrics such as overall employee count, attrition rates, active employees, average age, and job satisfaction ratings. It also includes department-wise attrition, age group distribution, education field-wise attrition, and gender-wise attrition rates across different age groups.


## Objectives:

- To visualize key HR metrics for better understanding of workforce composition and dynamics.

- To identify patterns and trends in employee attrition.

- To assess job satisfaction across different job roles.

## Goals:

- Enhance decision-making by providing a clear and concise visual representation of HR data.

- Identify areas of high attrition to develop targeted retention strategies.

- Improve employee satisfaction by understanding job satisfaction trends.

## Scope and Limitations
Scope:

- The dashboard covers overall employee statistics, department-wise and education field-wise attrition, age group distribution, gender-wise attrition rates, and job satisfaction ratings.
It provides insights for workforce planning and management.

## Limitations:

- The data/dashboard does not include reasons for employee departures (e.g., resignation or termination).

- The analysis is limited to the data available and does not account for external factors influencing attrition and satisfaction.

## Data Description

Data Sources: 

The data for this project was sourced from the company's HR database, which includes employee demographics, job roles, education fields, attrition records, and job satisfaction ratings.

Collection Methods: 

The data was extracted from the HR management system and compiled into a structured format for analysis and visualization.

## Methodology

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Steps.

Data Extraction: 

- Retrieved data from the HR management system.

Data Cleaning:

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.

- Handled missing values by imputing or excluding incomplete records.

- Standardized data formats for consistency (e.g., date formats, job titles).

Data Preprocessing:

- Categorized employees by age groups and education fields.

- Calculated attrition rates and job satisfaction scores.
 
- Aggregated data for visualization (e.g., department-wise attrition, job satisfaction ratings)

### Conclusion

- The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the company's workforce dynamics. It highlights key areas of concern, such as high attrition rates in specific departments and education fields, as well as variations in job satisfaction across different roles. The analysis of age group and gender-wise attrition rates further aids in understanding the workforce composition and potential areas for improvement.

### Recommendations

- Focus on departments with high attrition, such as Sales and HR, to develop retention initiatives.
  
- Address the needs and concerns of employees in Life Sciences and Medical fields to reduce attrition.

- Implement programs to enhance job satisfaction for roles with lower satisfaction scores, such as Sales Representatives and Healthcare Representatives.
  
- Conduct regular surveys to gather employee feedback and address any emerging issues promptly.

- Monitor gender-wise attrition rates and develop initiatives to support gender diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
 
- Provide support and development opportunities for younger employees to reduce early-career attrition.
  
- Regularly update the dashboard with the latest data to track changes and trends over time.

- Use the dashboard insights to inform HR policies and strategic decision-making.
